 colorado.1.t:0 "Political Violence Runs Amuck!" 
 colorado.1.d:0 "The Great Depression hit our state's leading economic activities: Mining and ranching extremely hard, resulting in even more political dissatisfaction with the status quo. Colorado is no stranger to political upheaval and violence as we've experienced what outsiders called a "State Civil War" back in 1913 with the Coalfield war. Still, the current situation is a significant step up from the previous war, ever since the Columbine Massacre in 1927 miners under the leadership of Amelia Sablich have become increasingly militant and ready for war, and now without Federal support that war may become inevitable in the next few months..." 
 colorado.1.a:0 "We must put an end to this!"

 colorado.3.d:0 "As tensions raise to a boiling point in Colorado due to the miner unrest we have decided to deputize thousands of more men, including Great War Veterans into the newly formed Colorado Rangers. Designed to be a sharpshooter light infantry unit to deal with civil unrest these new troops will prove to be crucial to crush the miners." 
 colorado.3.a:0 "This will surely calm the tensions!" 

 colorado.4.t:0 "Second Columbine Massacre!" 
 colorado.4.d:0 "Coloradans had hoped that the first Columbine Massacre would be the last, but it instead turned into a harbinger for things to come only nine years later. After the Dinosaur city shootout and the bounties being placed on Miner's heads the state was desperate to chase down to capture and or kill them. Detectives and Pinkertons searched the usual hotspots of red activity, and they had found it once again in the Columbine Mine, believing that the miner's leaders were held up in an abandoned schoolhouse nearby, the detectives began a siege of the abandoned building, armed miners were indeed inside of the building but, they had informed the men outside that there were also civilians located in the building. The Detectives did not believe this claim, and assumed it was a bluff, meanwhile the Sheriffs did and forced the rest to hold fire. In the foggy mist of the next day's morning reinforcements arrived, the State Guard, believing the poorly dressed local lawmen from a distance were the miners openned fire on them from a distance. This caused the detectives to rain volleys into the abandoned schoolhouse full of miner's and their families. Causing atrocious civilian casualties as some sherrifs joined in the volley throwing, believing that they were being shot from the building. In total 31 people, mostly civilians lay dead due to a friendly fire incident and lack of coordination between the three agencies present at the scene."
