    POLITICS_ALBERTRITCHIE_DESC:0 "Albert Ritchie is the State of Maryland's longest-serving governor with almost 15 years of public service. Ritchie's political career started off with a major victory for taxpayers after winning a lawsuit against a Baltimore utility company, with this populist appeal he secured his first political position. Ritchie later went on to become governor in 1919, with Ritchie serving out 4 out of his 5 terms in a span of 15 years. Ritchie narrowly won the 1934 Gubernatorial election after much controversy as many claim he only won since it was a war-time election during the Cheasapeake war. Ritchie's health is rapidly ailing and the Democratic Party he transformed into a corporate political machine has wreaked havoc on Maryland's economy. Vultures are swarming around Ritchie in his last few weeks alive to secure any inch of political power they can. Ritchie's legacy is one of success turned to stagnation and mediocrity in the face of major challenges."
