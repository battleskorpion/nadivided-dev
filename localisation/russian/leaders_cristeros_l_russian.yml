 POLITICS_ENRIQUE_DESC:0 "Enrique Gorostieta Velarde was born in Monterrey to a wealthy Mexican-Basque Family. He had been in the military since a young age due to his mothers encouragement, he served in counter-revolutionary dictator Victoriano Huerta's Federal army against the rebels, becoming Mexico's youngest general. After the Mexican Revolution he adopted a quiet life of a soap maker. But this all changed when the National League for the Defense of Religious Liberty chose him to be the leader of the Cristero army in 1927. He accepted this offer surprisingly even though he was a secular mason for the entirety of his life. Many question his loyalty to the Cristero ideals but he has managed to keep the Cristero forces united and formed into a proper army rather than bands of irregulars."
