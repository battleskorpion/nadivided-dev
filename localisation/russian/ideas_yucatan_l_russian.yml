  MYU_idea_hacienda_controlled_economy_desc:0 "The Yucatán Peninsula's (excluding Cruzob) economy is completly dominated by Henequen Haciendas, but recently large congolomerates have moved into the region to harvest the vast natural resources of Rubber, Oil and Limestone. The traditionally agricultural Haciendas are still dominant but they are fighting constantly with the new tides of business moving into the region. The Haciendas and Industrial congolomerates are both extremely unpopular amongst the working class however."

  MYU_idea_maya_resistance_desc:0 "The Cruzob have reconstituted the state of Chan Santa Cruz, this has caused a massive wave of unrest throughout Mayan inhabitated regions, as the Caste War has restarted and is now in it's second phase. Indigenous Maya have begun forming bands of guerrillas and attacking settlers, companies, Haciendas and army troops."

  MYU_minor_maya_resistance_desc:0 "Since the Caste War has restarted in the Yucatán, our state has also felt the shockwaves affecting us, albeit in a less extreme way. Maya's have formed small self defense militias in the hinterlands of our state and harass settlers, government forces and companies trying to encroach on their land. But this level of resistance is not as bad in comparision to the Yucatán Mayan resistance.However in the future this could change to become a much more serious situation."
