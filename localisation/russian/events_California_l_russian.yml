 california.1.t:0 "First Major Election"
 california.1.d:0 "Since the secession from the Union our prior president sadly passed away. Nevertheless acting President Frank Merriam is currently in the running under the Republican Party, which is backed by the political establishment during this race to prevent Upton Sinclair from winning. Merriams opponent is someone who proclaims to not be an extremist but is regarded by the establishment as one, Upton Sinclair is the leader of the End Poverty In California (EPIC) movement. Worker's unions' are in support as well as some socialists. If he were to win the election a political revolution would be underway in California."

 california.3.t:0 "The Phoenix Speech"
 california.3.d:0 "I will be brief in my comments. I was appointed many months ago to get the victory that, until moments ago, many in a foolheardty legislation thought impossible. Now I stand before you, the broken and tired enemy. I wish to make one thing clear to you; It is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died. Rather we should thank God that such men lived. In this model, we have seen a truth and understanding to our great American ideal, a process of hope for a reunification. Americans, across everywhere, will sooner or later be damned into uniting with eachother, for an American cannot live without associating with his other fellow Americans. Lincoln taught us that. Lincoln also taught us to not hide ourselves, to piss away, from an advantageous position, even if it meant the forceful nature that we Americans love to use. When I was offered the position months ago to take charge of this great State and to seek an immediate conclusion to threats other Americans posed to us, I accepted because of the shit-slinging belly-up bastard aching that I saw in our Capitol hill. I will remind you all of what I said many months ago, in exactly that situation taking office; A good solution applied with vigor now is better than a perfect solution applied ten minutes later. This has been a tough, brutal, and devestating fight. In time, you may hate us for our conquering. But you will be reminded and you will be led, for you are an American. And Americans, even if they hate every other place on earth, will, in the end, have to be together with other Americans. Wars may be fought with weapons, but they are won by men. It is the spirit of the men who follow and of the man who leads that gains the victory. And through our victory, by thanking the alive and by serving together, we can achieve an everlasting glory. Right, you damn Bolshevik naysayers!, you get what I mean, we'll take back our nation and we'll keep on moving at the bastards. That's all"

 california.10.t:0 "Communist Rebellion!"
 california.10.d:0 "The outbreak of the second longshoreman strike has now shifted into a full rebellion as disgruntled Chicano Workers and Socialists unite together to liberate the workers of California. Harry Bridges has taken the reins of this rebellion as it’s leader. The “People Republic of California” was proclaimed in San Francisco. Los Angeles has declared loyalty to the communist cause as other counties in Southern California followed suit, notably San Diego remains Republican territory and the Central Valley, our main agricultural hub, has also declared loyalty to the communists..\n\nCommunist partisans battle it off with weakened Republican force on the frontlines. The Californian government has been broken at its core,  vast territory and resources have been taken by the communists. The government can no longer coordinate anything effectively as Merriam scrambles to push new legislation and laws into the disloyal congress. General George Patton has repeatedly called for our government to hand absolute power to him."

Mexican street youth have taken up the fashion trend of 'Zoot Suits' a long jacket with baggy pants. During our current war these street youth have begun clashing with our military personnel stationed in the city since many working class Mexicans have been displaced by military installation expansion within the city. Tensions were high between the military and the Zoot Suiters and now they have boiled over into a riot after our sailors had an altercation with some Zoot-Suiters.
