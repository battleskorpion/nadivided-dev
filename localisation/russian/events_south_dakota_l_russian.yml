  southdakota.2.d:0 "North Dakota's vile Populist government has launched an attack upon our great state, attempting a surprise invasion while we were busy celebrating the new year and preparing to finally put the dust bowl economic crisis behind us. They have interrupted our plans of recovery and are hellbent on unifying our territory. The populace has been rallied by the State Guard, armories have been opened up and the South Dakota Light Infantry have been mobilized to the front. It is time to test our independence on the battlefield."
