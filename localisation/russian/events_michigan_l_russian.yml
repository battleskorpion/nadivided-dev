 michigan.17.t:0 "The Terror of the Black Legion"
 michigan.17.d:0 "    On a miserable day in Detroit, Charles Poole, a catholic union organizer hopped in a car hoping to get a ride to what potentially could be a new job. After a few unexpected twists and turns into the countryside he was instructed to leave the vehicle; the men in the front got out of the car before shooting Poole dead.\n \n    Someone witnessed the incident but couldn’t clearly identify the two men, but many suspect them to be members of the nefarious Black Legion. This is because the Black Legion has harassed him before, accusing him of abusing his baptist wife. They were not fond of Catholics or Union Organizers for that matter. Reports to the police were made, before being shortly filed away. Private investigators were hired by Poole’s family to investigate the murder.\n \n    The murderers have not been identified, with many accusing the Michigan justice system of ignoring the murder to protect the Black Legion. The incident has grown to a statewide issue, with journalists pressuring the government to crackdown on the Black Legion. Normally the Black Legion is largely ignored, but this incident hit close to many. Wayne County Prosecutor Duncan McRae has made no statement to the press.\n \n    Black Legion crimes have previously been more discreet, or at least, were discarded as accidents by police. Car crashes, arson, unusual deaths, among other coincidental events of misfortune towards Catholics and blacks, would suspiciously be categorized as accidents by a Black Legion controlled Justice system. The Black Legion would use threats to coerce more people into the organization; now that their activities were made widely known, the Legion has only expanded their methods with more threats and violences."

 michigan.19.t:0 "International Police Raid Black Legion"
 michigan.19.d:0 "    As the Black Legion solidifies control of Michigan, justice becomes scarce for many. Poole’s family is still mourning the loss of Charles, who was shot by two of the Black Legion’s members. Despite an uproar from the media, there has been no effective action against the injustice - the public justice system has discarded it.\n \n    Not only has there been no justice for Poole’s family, but there have also been threats. These threats persisted even after fleeing Michigan for Illinois. Threats would arrive in the mail, threatening repercussions for their investigation of the incident. Paranoia has captivated the family, with many afraid of the shadows - of those in black robes.\n \n    Fortunately, the family is being protected by the Untouchables - a private police force led by former FBI agent Eliot Ness. They have been investigating the incident, and have drawn to a conclusion: Black Legion Members Dayton Dean and Ervin Lee were responsible for the murder of Charles Poole.\n \n    In Michigan, Untouchables break into Dayton Dean’s apartment and arrest him before conducting a thorough investigation of the premises. Ervin Lee would see a similar raid - the two members would be put on trial. Ervin Lee would remain silent, but Dayton Dean betrays the Legion and reveals the names of twelve high-profile members for a greatly reduced sentence. The information has been shocking, and has led to the Black Legion ostracizing him and accusing him of every misfortune to face the Black Legion."

 michigan.20.t:0 "Black Legion Trial of Dayton Dean"
 michigan.20.d:0 "    The filth of the Joliet Correctional Center has proved unbearable for Dayton Dean, luckily his deal is soon going to make him a free man. The untouchables have successfully led a series of raids in Michigan, arresting high-profile members of the Black Legion as a result of Dayton Dean’s betrayal. This has prompted the Black Legion to mark him as a traitor, and has made him the subject of scapegoating for the past couple of years.\n \n    As the gates of the prison open, he becomes renewed. Regrets have burrowed in his soul, and he has renounced any connections to the Black Legion especially since he is their enemy. He was going to start a new life. He has come to regret his many actions under the black robe, and the only way to forget is to drink. In a lonely Chicago bar, he would grab yet another drink. He thought back to when he saw Poole’s wife, she was not happy to see Charles dead - she denied the abuse - she was mourning him. Hatred had blinded the Black Legion.\n \n    After a fourth shot of Whiskey, Dayton Dean would grow increasingly tired - he would begin his walk home. Until suddenly a figure dragged him to the alleyway. After fading in and out, he was back in jail - but a Michigan jail this time. The guards were Black Legion members, and they wanted revenge. Weeks later he is put on the stand, but is unable to defend his betrayal. It was only a show trial in a Kangaroo court. The noose tightens around his neck, and he is hanged."
