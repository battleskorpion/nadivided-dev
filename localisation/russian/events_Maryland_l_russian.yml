     maryland.1.t:0 "Our Governor has Died" 
     maryland.1.d:0 "Late last night, Governor Albert Ritchie died of a brain hemorrhage. Ritchie was the longest serving Governor, being elected as Governor in 1920. His death come as a shock to many because he wasn't yet an old man. On top of this, many fear riots may ensue as Ritchie faced a tough election in 1934 which left many screaming that he cheated. In this power vacuum Field Marshal Pedro del Valle has stepped in declaring marshal law. The Maryland Guard has rallied behind Valle and seem to be aping the military junta of those dirty New Jersians. Since the state has no Lt. Governor to succeed Ritchie, many have already accepted the grim reality that a civil war would lead to a Federal Invasion." 
     maryland.1.a:0 "God Help Us!" 

     maryland.2.t:0 "Riots" 
     maryland.2.d:0 "Riots have broken out in Annapolis over the Valle dictatorship. Socialists and liberal students have began demanding an \"end to the fascist regime\". Labor Unions, whom long been put in check by Ritchie, have gone on a general strike. We have two options, send in the official army or the BEF. Our army may clean up the mess quickly, but we will be seen as a dictator rather than a man of the people. The BEF under Walter Waters, can clean up the mess without our government being blamed." 
     maryland.2.a:0 "Army is on there way!" 
     maryland.2.b:0 "BEF Men on the Way!" 

     maryland.3.t:0 "Investment Option" 
     maryland.3.d:0 "Under our new and stronger leadership, we are ready to build factories for our new Maryland. However, we must choose between putting two civilian factories in Baltimore or three military ones in east Maryland. We should remember D.C is an constant threat. If they break through, their army they could easily seize our civilian factories if we choose to lay them in Baltimore. Arms factories would be safer bet since we can put them in the East where federal troops will have harder time to getting to." 
     maryland.3.a:0 "Baltimore is Worth it!" 
     maryland.3.b:0 "Eastern Maryland will be built up!" 

     maryland.6.t:0 "Chesapeake Bay War" 
     maryland.6.d:0 "When the Union fell in 1932 it was not without bloodshed. In the dying days of the Union President Hoover backed by loyalist New Jersey choose to usurp Maryland on the eve of Christmas. That snowy day 2000 treasonous Maryland Guardsmen seized Annapolis declaring secession illegal and arrested Governor Ritchie. Thus, began a quick occupation of Maryland by US General Douglas MacArthur whom became acting military Governor. With this, the federal government began moving into Northern Virginia to bring the state back into the Union by force. The Chesapeake Bay War began on January the 2nd 1933. Despite this, Marylanders held strong as Maryland patriots seized the captured Governor from federal hands. On February 2nd, Ritchie gave a radio speech to \"throw the federal invaders out of Maryland!\". The people quickly took up arms and sent General MacArthur fleeing to Baltimore. From there, the Hooverite War effort collapsed ending with a ceasefire on March 1st 1933."

     maryland.7.t:0 "Beware of New Jersey" 
     maryland.7.d:0 "We must never forget New Jersey is an enemy. When the federals tried to destroy us in 1932, the New Jersey dog occupied Delaware for their greedy selves. However, New Jersey and the federals had an inner dispute; The New Jersey government sought to effectively annex Delaware into a \"greater New Jersey\". Not just them, but also the Eastern half of our own state which was then occupied by the cowardly General MacArthur. By February 1933 we had quickly retaken control of our state to the shock of the New Jersey army in Delaware. Virginian Volunteer forces cleaned up Southern Delaware within a few days. By the last week, New Jersey's Army was surrounded in the West and South of the Chesapeake Peninsula by the combined forces of Virginia and Maryland. New Jersey sought to pull troops across the Bay but found themselves blocked by Pennsylvania navy angered by the tyrannical actions of those filthy stinking New Jerseys. Thus, New Jersey would agree to the March 1st ceasefire in part due to the threat of the destruction of their army. Our forces were sad to watch those bastards escape death as they made their way, unarmed, into Pennsylvania back through Filth-a-delphia. Had General Valle or Governor Ritchie had their way, we would had finished them, then and there. However, Virginia held us back. Within a month of the ceasefire the military of New Jersey took over the state. We now possibly face a return those devils……."

The Feds shot us and left us for dead, for 3 long years the bonus army has surrounded the capitol, and still they continue to deny us what they owe us.

     maryland.80.d:0 "BEF has crushed the filthy rioters and strikers. 500 heavily armed veterans managed to quickly send the rabble back into hiding. Walter has declared victory for \"all patriotic citizens over the forces of anarchy and hate\". However, Walter's growing popularity should be of some concern. Many people in our state see Waters as hero who helped throw Hoover out of our nation. Waters has an strong core of veterans personally loyal to him. It isn't hard to see, this man is backing a counter coup to put their khaki man in power."

     maryland.81.d:0 "Our small army has engaged the rioters and killed 20 of them. We lost only 2 men in the firefight in Annapolis, but we have won the day.

     maryland.83.t:0 "BEF wants Bonus Bill" 
     maryland.83.d:0 "After years of demanding a bonus bill the Bonus Expeditionary Force, led by Walter, has demanded we pay them the full bonus bill payment for their services in the World War. They made the same to Hoover before the Union fell, some argue those tough veterans were the cause of the collapse. Despite the Maryland government allowing them to virtually squat on whatever land they please for the last four years, it seems the veterans want their full payment. Considering there's possibly 30,000 plus men of the BEF scattered across the state it will be a mighty sum to pay. On top of that more veterans are likely to move into the state to get a paycheck. On the other hand, denying them the bonus checks could have dangerous consequences for our country."

He claims he respects General Valle and will not take up arms such a \"brave and heroic man\". His speech has caused many of the roughest BEF men to back off from plans to march on the capitol. Walter sent us a personal letter to thank us for passing the Bonus Bill and promises loyalty to our government."

Considering our army is mostly green and is against the experience veterans of the Bonus Army, we must flee! Baltimore likewise seems to have a BEF march too. Valle's rule has come to an speedy end."

     maryland.100.d:0 "General Valle has taken over Maryland and is now threatening our little District over the radio today. The Marine Corp has too long been a thorn in our side. We should not underestimate the General from Puerto Rico. Hard to think the General was a unionist until we denounced him in 1932 for demanding we invade California right after they seceded. Since then, he has damned President Hoover and Democracy \"as weak and cowardly\". He led marines in the Chesapeake Bay War against our forces in Maryland. It is very likely General Valle plans to wipe our Democracy off the face of the map in some sort of revenge fantasy. The longer we allow Maryland to breath the stronger the \"Maryland Caudillo\" becomes. We must crush Maryland."
