American Patriots strongly opposed the taxes in the Townshend Act as a violation of their rights. Demonstrators, some disguised as Native Americans, destroyed an entire shipment of tea sent by the East India Company."

This was the famous M1, or "Garand rifle" as it came to be known. The army adopted the rifle in 1936, and production began the next year."
