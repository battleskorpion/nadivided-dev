# Blumenfield's Syndicate
 mobbesota.1.t:0 "The Syndicate Seizes Minnesota!"
 mobbesota.1.d:0 "Reports are flowing in today as, from Minneapolis to abroad, the "Syndicate" headed by Isadore Blumenfield, known as “Kid Cann”, and his Blumenfield Crime Family, have seized control over the entire state of Minnesota. Through the genius of the Blumenfield’s leadership, the Syndicate spent years infiltrating key positions of authority by bribing and manipulating high-level officials, first in Minneapolis, the heart of operations, but then state-wide, developing an intricate web that gave the Syndicate a high level of control over Minnesota before they seized the governorship and the state senate.The Syndicate has been reported to be highly oppressive, forcing the people of Minnesota to abide by their iron fist or to be liable for intense consequences, including imprisonment, execution, and even torture in rarer cases. America watches as, for the first time, a crime family has successfully established their own country, and the future looks daunting for the people, not just in Minnesota, but across the American continent."
