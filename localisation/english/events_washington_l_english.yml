washington.1.t:0 "The Dire Situation At Hand"
washington.1.d:0 "Since the demise of the Union Washington State has been rocked by a wave of radicalism with its origins dating back decades. Since the turn of the century, Washington had been a hotspot for the ideas of the Socialist Party & Industrial Workers of the World, with both clashing against right wing forces in our state and staging the infamous 1919 Seattle General Strike which was inspired by the Bolshevik Revolution. Counter-Revolutionaries over time also stepped up to the plate such as the KKK, American Legion and most recently the Union Party. From 1934-1935 Our State was walloped by 2 massive strikes that hit our biggest industries: The 1934 West Coast Waterfront strike and the 1935 Pacific Northwest Timber Strike, both devastating our economy temporarily and causing dozens of deaths and casualties as the far left and far right duke it out in our streets while the National Guard continues rapid militarization and expansion to counter these extremes who are taking advantage of the lingering Great Depression still effecting our state due to the status quo's constant bickering and lack of action on solving the depression. The people of Washington are growing weary with the lack of change or improvement while extremists continue to fan the flames of division to prepare a power grab in this election year. Many fear our State will end up down the same route as Oregon if this is allowed to continue. If Washington is to keep the Democratic Capitalist torch burning throughout the Pacific Northwest, it must take drastic measures now."
