washington.1.t:0 "The Dire Situation At Hand"
washington.1.d:0 "Since the demise of the Union Washington State has been rocked by a wave of radicalism with its origins dating back decades. Since the turn of the century, Washington had been a hotspot for the ideas of the Socialist Party & Industrial Workers of the World, with both clashing against right wing forces in our state and staging the infamous 1919 Seattle General Strike which was inspired by the Bolshevik Revolution. Counter-Revolutionaries over time also stepped up to the plate such as the KKK, American Legion and most recently the Union Party. From 1934-1935 Our State was walloped by 2 massive strikes that hit our biggest industries: The 1934 West Coast Waterfront strike and the 1935 Pacific Northwest Timber Strike, both devastating our economy temporarily and causing dozens of deaths and casualties as the far left and far right duke it out in our streets while the National Guard continues rapid militarization and expansion to counter these extremes who are taking advantage of the lingering Great Depression still effecting our state due to the status quo's constant bickering and lack of action on solving the depression. The people of Washington are growing weary with the lack of change or improvement while extremists continue to fan the flames of division to prepare a power grab in this election year. Many fear our State will end up down the same route as Oregon if this is allowed to continue. If Washington is to keep the Democratic Capitalist torch burning throughout the Pacific Northwest, it must take drastic measures now."

washington.2.d:0 "The election year of 1936 has proven to be the most bloody and chaotic in recent history, with our state narrowly avoiding a Communist uprising, it is time to return to our democratic ideals and settle on a suitable, hopefully non radical candidate..."

washington.10.d:0 "Following the Battle of Issaquah, the Reds gathered their forces in Seattle and declared the Second Seattle General Strike in order to paralyze our state's control over the city and seize power for themselves. Workers have been organized by the CPW and IWW in collaboration, and armories have been broken into as the police flee the overwhelming numbers of reds. As red banners fly over the Seattle area, chaos has engulfed our largest city and main industrial center. Washington's civil war has officially begun."
washington.10.a:0 "Rally the National Guard!"
washington.10.b:0 "§RHoist the Banner of Labor High!(Join Them)§R"

washington.4.t:0 "The Second Everett Massacre"
washington.4.d:0 "The day started off typically as the IWW and their supporters rallied in Everett for a monthly memorial march to the dockyards to commemorate the beginning of 1936, which marked the 20th anniversary of the first Everett Massacre. Nobody expected any commotion until a large police force arrived at the docks, backed up by local posse members. The IWW was blocked off from entering the Calista steamboat by the Police & their posse and then things turned violent, fast. A brawl ensued and then shots were fired in a close-range engagement that began inside the crowd which was bound to cause collateral damage. In total 14 men and women lay dead at the Everett docks again, this time 20 years later. It remains unclear which side started the brawl and who shot first but governor Martin and the media put the blame on the Reds."
washington.4.a:0 "When will people stop repeating history?!"

washington.5.t:0 "Lake Sammamish Massacre"
washington.5.d:0 "As tensions have continuously grown in our state the far left and far right have continued to clash. This time a massacre has occurred over a lakeside picnic! The CPW planned on having a women's day picnic at Lake Sammamish until their plans were abruptly ended during an encounter with the Silver Legion that spun out of control. Eyewitnesses claim the Legionnaires approached the picnic goers and their husbands and tried provoking them into fighting. Instead of a knuckle sandwich, they received a hail of bullets as everyone along the lake scrambled for cover. The pitched battle lasted for about 40 minutes until emergency services could arrive and broker a ceasefire to tend to the wounded as both sides scrambled away to avoid charges. In total 7 men on both sides and 2 women lay dead at the end of the massacre. Many see the increased political violence in our state as a sign of what's coming next..."

washington.11.t:0 "Crush The Socialists in Seattle!"
washington.11.d:0 "The Reds used their general strike to gain full control over the city and its surronding suburbs, as the rich flee to state controlled land out of fear of reprisals and wealth redistribution. We are forced to act with the upmost authority and harsh force on these Reds if we want to prevent Communist Totalitarianism from taking over our beloved state!"
washington.11.a:0 "Attack!"
