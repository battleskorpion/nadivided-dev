  POLITICS_CHARLES_MARTIN_DESC:0 "Charles Martin, a retired US Army Major General and division commander of the Blackhawk division has made a name for himself in Oregon politics in the past few years. From supporting the construction of the Bonneville Dam to now pretending to be a progressive Democrat to gain presidency. Martin is quite the polar opposite of any sort of progressive. Martin is an unabashed supporter of big business and is in favor of giving them tax cuts and using the Army and other methods to support big business against labor, as Martin brands labor unions and practically anyone who opposes him as a 'Gangster Bolshevik!' Martin being a borderline fascist can explain much of his past actions as well, such as forcing Black Great War Veterans to clean up toilets, deal with rotting corpses and brand them as 'The Rapist Division'. Martin will prove to be one of, if not the most right wing president Oregon will ever have"
