The Monarch, be him Tsar, Kaiser or King, rules with power that is solely judicial in nature, the Monarch is the final court of appeals in other words. The Soviets, or Worker Councils, take the place of a Congress and President, as they hold both Legislative and Executive Power. The Soviets are divided into three categories: local, regional and national, each level deals with issues that are within their purview. Each local Soviet is made up of the local people from that area, the Regional Soviets are elected by the local Soviets, and the National is elected by the regional Soviets. Unlike other forms of Socialism or Communism, Class Conflict is emphasized little or not at all. Instead, Soviet Monarchists hold to a more left-leaning form of Corporatism. Along with this is a much different approach to Religion. Unlike the State Atheism of the Soviet Union, Soviet Monarchists embrace a form of Integralism, based on the majority religion in the nation they happened to be based. Wrap this all in a bow of extreme nationalism, and you have a recipe for perhaps the most strange ideology to emerge in 20th Century"
