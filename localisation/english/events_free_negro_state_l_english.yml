 free_negro_state.1.d:0  "Nergoes across the Deep South have met to offically create a government for our new nation. While young Anglo Herdon has served as Provisonal President for our struggle for Indepedence against Alabmama, many question his leadership. Among those is Ned Cobb, a gurilla fighter who bombed and stole numerous equipment from the Alabama Republic. Cobb dreams of uniting the Deep South fully under Negroes and breaking up the plantations. Herndon belives we should take time to industrilize and work with liberals and socialists in the North."

 free_negro_state.3.d:0  "After winning their war against Alabama the Free Negro State has called on us to defend them if attacked. Young President Herdon begs us to declare that New York will protect their newly found nation from \"Negro hatin Dixie states\". In doing so we will no doubt become more involved in the South as a whole. However, this could help us spread Democracy to the Jim Crow region and thus further our influence. On the otherhand we have our own racial and labor issues that could be bloated if we go down South in the named of blacks."

Being led by infamous Negro-Communist James Ford they have formed a rebel state of Shermanland. Damn coloreds named the country after the dastardly General Sherman!

 free_negro_state.8.d:0 "Shermanland has dug into the Coastal region and raised an army. Likewise with Free Negro States gurentee over them we will have to fight to two front war. New York may also decide to get involved to protect Free Negro State. However, our people clamor for War. General Lindely Camp says if we are able to quickly lay out Shermanland we can hold Savvannah down to keep Yankees out. Likewise he feels Herdon's boys ain't ready for war. In 1872 we threw out the carpet bagger and the negro. Can we do it again?"
 free_negro_state.8.a:0 "Strike them Down"
  free_negro_state.8.b:0 "There is nothing we can do now."
