  arkansas.4.t:0 "State of Arkansas"
  arkansas.4.d:0 "When Arkansas left the Union in July of 1932 it was done with much worry and fear. While a strong Democrat state many worried of what the federal government may do it a secessionist Arkansas as such it only followed after Louisiana, Mississippi and Georgia left. The same year was when current Governor Futrell was elected.  Futrell is an old school conservative Democrat but one who occasionally can bend to times. However due to the state going bankrupt in 1934 he has begun shutting down the view social programs the state had. Futrell is backed by the legislatures but also faces much opposition albeit they are divided. Futrell remains in power due to his re-election in 1934 and plans to win the Democratic Primary this year. Arkansas may do well under such a stable leader but also may go down a dark path as we spiral further into economic depression."

For in 1924 his run for Governor collapsed when he accidently split the Klan vote bringing the organization’s political machine to a halt. Cazhort a less than glorious comeback when elected as Lt Governor in 1928. Yet in 1930 his second attempt to become Governor failed miserably. Again, however luck jumped in Cazhorts pocket as the secession crisis came in 1932. Cazhort cursed and spit on Hoover demanding Arkansas be free. He even overlooked new Klan Cazhort chapters in Little Rock. His fight won his the Lt Governorship in 32’ and 34’. Since then he has rebuilt the Klan into a formidable force in the state as he seeks to finally take the prize that has escaped his grasp for over a decade. "

Thus, after the fall of the Union and several natural disasters and floods it should not be surprising It returns to Arkansas. The Southern Tenant Farmer Union formed in 1934 has made much progress in the two years of it’s formation that nearly half the share croppers of the state have joined it’s ranks.

Numerous shoot outs have broken out in the last two years. Due to this many members of STFU have armed themselves and engaged in street fights.
