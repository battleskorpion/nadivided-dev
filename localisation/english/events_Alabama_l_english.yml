      alabama.1.t:0 "Our Governor"
      alabama.1.d:0 "Many outsiders consider Alabama gifted due to its current head of State Bibb Graves. Graves has been a leading voice of moderation in the further radicalizing South. A veteran of World War 1 and prior elected Governor in 1926, and nonConsecutively in 1934, Governor Graves has stood strong on his platform of helping the common man over the wealthy planters and industrialists of the state. While not in the office in 1932 he was a leading unionist albeit his efforts to remain in the Union failed when Georgia seceded. While Alabama now remains an isolationist Republic, many younger political factions remain in the shadows for the 1938 Governor election. In which Graves is unable to run."
      alabama.1.a:0 "A Good Governor!"
  
      alabama.2.t:0 "Jeffersonian Democrat Party"
      alabama.2.d:0 "The Jeffersonian Democrat Party is a brainchild of the former US Senator James Thomas Heflin. Heflin has long been a political figure in Alabama politics and even nationally. However, his anti-Catholic and ultra segregationist speeches around the country even refused to support Catholic Democratic Nominee Al Smith in 1926. Business leaders of the state rallied against him, refusing him the democratic renomination in 1930. Heflin ran as a Jeffersonian Democrat. While he lost he managed to get 40% of the vote in the independent south. Since then he has spent his time damning the Republican Hoover, the Big Mules, and blacks. However, many see him as a declining figure in the Jeffersonian Democrat Party, soon to be overshadowed by younger men."
      alabama.2.a:0 "Will this man be Governor?"
      
      alabama.3.t:0 "Representative Connor denounces Graves"
      alabama.3.d:0 "Representative Eugene Bull Connor of Birmingham has denounced the Governor as weak on the labor issue. Connor has demanded full protections for all white labor organizations in the state from Northern strikebreakers. He demanded the Governor throw \"yankee\" strikebreakers out of the state using the Army Like Talmadge in Georgia. This news comes as a shock to many in the Democrat Party as Connor stumped for the House in 1934 as a stern defender of the progressive Graves. Such news may split up harmony among Bibbs' North Alabama faction already being nibbled on by Tom Cotton"
      alabama.3.a:0 "What a bunch of Bull!"
      
      alabama.4.t:0 "Letter from a Scottsboro Boy"
      alabama.4.d:0 "The Young Negro Eugene Williams has written us from prison asking that we consider pardoning him or at the very least the commutation of his sentence. Eugene and the other eight Scottsboro Boys were sentenced to death in 1932 for accusations of raping two white women on a train depot. They were sentenced to hang in December of 1938. The judge sentenced them to hang later than usual due to backlash from the Northern Press and local Negro organizers. The case is gaining more traction outside of Alabama despite most Negroes here not seeming to care. Pardoning them could enrage the many in the South. Many Democrats fear that a pardon for the boys could swing the backlash to put the small but aggressive Jeffersonian Democratic parties into power."
      alabama.4.a:0 "I may have to look into the case more."
      
      alabama.5.t:0 "Tom Cotton For Governor"
      alabama.5.d:0 "Tom Cotton Heflin has announced he will officially throw his white hat into the ring. Heflin has promised to run on the Jeffersonian Democrat ticket. Much of his party have already congratulated him on winning a JDP primary. Heflin promises to stand strong on his old hardline issues as anti-papalism. Heflin made it clear he believes that Catholics plan to create a rebel state just like they did in Oregon. Likewise, he claims Negroes are plotting an overthrow of our Republic. A possible bloody Negro-catholic revolution by the elder statesmen."
      alabama.5.a:0 "Good Old Cotton Tom!"
      
      
      alabama.6.t:0 "Bull Connor for Governor"
      alabama.6.d:0 "In a shock to many, Representative Connor has issued a challenge, not to Democratic candidates but Heflin. Connor claims that he was never notified of a said Primary. Had so, he claims he would have won. Jeffersonian Democrats seemed in a flurry as many assumed Connor was a diehard Democrat. Likewise, Democrats such as Frank Dixon and Chauncey Sparks have scorned Connor as a roughneck turncoat to the Party of his forefathers. Connor says he believes he’s doing what’s right and that the old Democratic Party can’t be fixed due to Big Mule Ring influence and money."
      alabama.6.a:0 "Eugene Connor!"
      
      
      alabama.7.t:0 "Connor and Heflin Feud"
      alabama.7.d:0 "Thomas Heflin has announced today that he was not notified by Mr. Connor of his membership not candidacy in the Jeffersonian Party. In a heated call, the two exchanged words. Both have been made public. Connor believes the 69-year-old Heflin is holding the party back in the state. He has a new vision for Alabama that isn’t held back by religious conspiracies. Connor claims the state party should abandon its anti-Catholic roots like those in Alabama and Georgia if it’s to gain power. Otherwise, he believes they will retain only a few seats in the house and never achieve the success of Huey P Long. Despite this, Heflin has made it clear there'll be no second JDP primary. However, he did thank Connor for joining \" his"\ party."
      alabama.7.a:0 "Jeffersonian Democrats may lose if this keeps up."
      
      
      alabama.8.t:0 "Cotton Tom in Tuscaloosa"
      alabama.8.d:0 "In Tuscaloosa, today to a rally of 30,0000 Cotton Tom announced he will seek to improve relations with Georgia. He also seeks to finally solve the racial question by possibly deporting blacks to Jamaica, seemingly endorsing Mississippi’s Bilbo Jamaican plan. He however remained silent on whether he would support organized labor. He did, however, open up a new can of worms by supporting the Klan who have remained largely broken in the previous years."
      alabama.8.a:0 "A Good Governor!"
      
      
      alabama.9.t:0 "Ned Cobb Sited in Eufaula"
      alabama.9.d:0 "Today our negro agents have brought news that wanted outlaw Ned Cobb was sited in Eufaula awaiting to meet another colored. Who this second person is we don't know as of yet. Cobb has been on the lamb since a 1932 Christmas shootout in which police tried to seize his farm. Cobb has been known to be the leader of the Alabama Sharecroppers Union, a group of colored Sharecroppers fighting against unfair pay and treatment. Nonetheless, Ned should be brought to justice for the murder of the sheriff. We also have some rumors that he has killed other local police since then."     
      alabama.9.a:0 "What Could he be planning?"
      
      
      alabama.10.t:0 "Frank Dixion For Governor"
      alabama.10.d:0 "Frank Murray Dixon has declared himself a candidate for Governor in the Democrat Primary in May. Dixon is a Birmingham lawyer who is a strong advocate for remaining loyal to the Democrat Party. Dixon also is a respected member of the American Legion. In 1934 he ran for Governor against current Governor Graves. Dixon seems to be keen to reform the bloated state government. Dixon has bragged about his war record as a volunteer in the Canadian air force. He proudly reminds people how he lost his leg fighting the Germans while his opponents were sitting at home. His youthful image may be enough to allow him to win the primary but will it get him over Cotton Tom and Bull Connor?"
      alabama.10.a:0 "An old Rival returns"
      
      
      alabama.11.t:0 "Dixon wins Democratic Primary"
      alabama.11.d:0 "Dixon has won the Democratic Primary easily beating Chauncey Sparks. Dixon has declared he will take Alabama to a new era clear of \"Long-esque\" demagoguery and clownish buffoonery of Cotton Tom."
      alabama.11.a:0 "Next up the General Election!"
      
      alabama.12.t:0 "Communist at Sharecroppers Union Meeting"
      alabama.12.d:0 "Anglo Herndon has long been on our radar for a while now. He’s long been active in communist Negro causes and as such was arrest by the Georgia government in 1932. He was charged under Georgia's insurrection statute and convicted in 1933 to many Northern papers' outrage. He however was able to escape a chain gang in 1934 and made his escape to New York. Since then, we have worked with Georgia’s Governor Talmadge to keep tabs on the colored boy. He is collecting cash in the North and funneling it into various southern states. As such a sighting of him in Alabama is extremely worrisome."
      alabama.12.a:0 "Now there are two of them!"
      
      
      alabama.13.t:0 "Connor will Run"
      alabama.13.d:0 "Eugene Connor has made it clear he will indeed run for Governor in the general election against Cotton Tom and Frank Dixon. Many Democrats fear the outcome as both Connor and Dixon are from Birmingham, one of Alabama’s largest cities, and thus they may split the vote. If so, Heflin may have a good chance of pulling himself over the edge. Connor has made it clear that all white men have the right to organize, and he has made it equally clear that he hates communism. Connor blames the wealthy of the state for the current depression, saying they hog all the loot for themselves while the working class and sharecroppers starve. His appeal has been growing with many in South Alabama flocking to his rallies. If he brings North Alabama against Heflin, he too may have a chance."

      alabama.14.d:0 "New York Governor Lehman has sent us a letter today on behalf of the people of New York requesting we spare the lives of the Scottsboro boys. Lehman says there is no proof that they committed the crime of rape and even if so don’t deserve to violently hang from the gallows. He suggests it will be better to pardon them and quickly rush them to New York. He even has suggested in the letter that he knows people who can give us a seat on the board of major companies /"for this act of bravery in the face of bigotry/" ."
      alabama.14.a:0 "Hmmmmm"
      
      alabama.15.t:0 "Fate of the Scottsboro Boys"
      alabama.15.d:0 "The day has arrived for the Scottsboro Boys to be executed for being convicted of rape of two white women. The question is shall we commute their sentence due to the fact they may not be guilty? Or shall we let them hang? Either will have large implications for our people across Dixie. By allowing them to hang we satisfy the bloodthirst of the Jeffersonian Democrats but we also will enrage the black population of the South. By commuting, we face a JPD backlash. We must decide today."
      alabama.15.a:0 "Commute their sentences."
      alabama.15.b:0 "§RLet them Hang!"
      
      alabama.16.t:0 "Blacks Rise Up" 
      alabama.16.d:0 "In the aftermath of our Government's decision to allow for the Scottsboro boys to be executed it now seems several black-red uprisings have broken out across the South. We have news that several cities in the black belt have been seized by the two outlaws, Anglo Herdon and Ned Cobb. These coloreds have declared a  \"Negro Free State\" in the area. We have local police dealing with this now but we will likely have to act soon or face it spreading into the Eastern Part of the Black Belt Region of our country."

      alabama.18.d:0 "Bibb Graves was the governor of our fine state for many years but today he has sadly passed away from old age-related natural causes in his sleep. He died at age 68. Our state mourns the loss of a renowned statesman. His death has left   doubts about a revival of the progressive-moderate Democrat faction in the 1942 election as Graves planned to run this year."

Both of our countries were founded by the Spanish, both of us were once slave-holding states, and both of us fought for the Confederacy. Even after reconstruction we largely have voted for the same President in almost every single election. Despite all this one man has been causing a divide between our two small Southern Republics. That man is David Scholtz. Sholtz was elected Governor in 1932, the same year the Union fell, and thus after being inaugurated he was made Florida’s first real President. In an effort to raise funds he’s taxed all of our boats going anywhere near Florida’s large coastline. This has effectively locked our exports and even imports outs from leaving the Gulf of Mexico. While we can send to other states, we still need goods from Europe and Asia not to mention exporting there. To make matters worse Governor Scholtz has done this to no other former US republic. Seemingly he has decided to effectively bully us due to our single small port in Mobile all to raise money for his social programs and increase his own power."
