 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "In the last few years the world has seen some new wars break out in Europe and Asia. Spain is now governed by nationalists and Japan has fought both the Soviet Union and China for territory, the latter being a more successful battle for Japan. The new non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany may be bad news for the rest of Europe."
 
 #GATHERING STORM
 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The Divided Union"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The World was sent into a dark future when France extended their occupation of the Ruhr in Germany in 1925. With the occupation extended, the United Kingdom gave permission to Germany to partially rearm in the event of further French occupation. In 1931 the Second Great War began with France and Italy on one side and the United Kingdom and Germany on the other, as the years passed more nations would join the war. In North America, the Great Depression combined with the cancelation of the relief fund for Veterans as well as the postponement of the elections by the president, Herbert Hoover, came together to form the conditions for the United States, the centuries long experiment, to finally come to an end. The former states of the Union, now independent, are looking to make a name for themselves in the biggest battle royal the modern centuries has ever seen."

 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the biggest battle royale the modern world has ever seen, the many new nations of North America are looking to make a name for themselves among the sea of other breakaway countries from the United States, Canada, and Mexico - the latter barely holding on."
 SID_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Even before the breakup of the United States, Idaho found herself in a difficult situation. Throughout the Roaring Twenties, Idaho was already feeling Great Depression-like effects. The Breakup of the Union only make these problems more severe. Without the support of the rest of the Union, Idaho finds her resources without a market, her people without goods and basic industrial needs, and a slowly diminishing food stockpile. Can Idaho pull out of this slump and finally fix the economic stagnation that's plagued her since the end of the Great War? Or will Idaho only continue to rot like the potatoes planted in the soil? Only time will tell..."
 PON_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As the English successor of Canada a lot of weight has been put on Ontario's shoulders since the breakup of Canada. Unlike Quebec, the French successor for Canada, Ontario holds the old Canadian government in power, this has created much distrust in the population towards the government. While Ontario would normally be in an ideal situation to retake Canada, there are many internal problems which hold the country back. One such problem is dealing with the old Canadian Navy and Army, if they are not dealt with in some way the population's distrust in the government will only grow. Another is the problem of the industry, without the resources of the far north and west the Ontario economy is stagnating, but can easily be rejuvenated with the right policies and political actions. Will Ontario be able to regain trust in their population and reunite Canada, or will Ontario continue to stagnate as merely just another country on the North American continent?"
 SOR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As the Union was falling apart in late 1929, Governor Patterson, along with the Legislature, declared Oregon to be an independent Republic. The state's constitution was, for the most part, left intact with only a few changes made to meet the new challenges of being a Nation-state. Since the fall of the Union, Oregon has been happy enough to drift into the protection of their southern neighbor, even adopting a new flag based on that of California, to represent the two nations' cooperation. However, this happy of state of affairs would not last. Although present since 1926, the Oregon Red Army, led by John Reed, began to have massive victories against the National Guard in the fall of 1934, reaching the outskirts of Salem before they were pushed back to the Cascades in the winter of '35. Since being pushed back, the ORA has been unusually silent. Many within the High Command see this as a sign that the ORA is close to defeat, however more senior officers fear that the silence means that the Reds are planning something big..."  
 CUBA_GATEHRING_STORM_DESC:0 "Without the United States breathing down the neck of Cuba, it is in a prime position to proclaim itself as the rightful leader of the whole of the Caribbean. However, rivals may arise in response in the form of the Antilles Federation and some of the remnants of the United States."
 SNJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As the Union fell apart in rapid succession, New Jersey quickly found itself engulfed in chaos. Riots in the streets and demands for independence, these ‘protests’ were swiftly eliminated and a state of emergency was declared. With the Union’s full collapse the Military Junta reigns with no checks in place, though discontent remains to radicalize the populus. The Final state, New Jersey, is in a precarious position. Will the flame of Democracy burn out? Or will the embers of revolution take a revanchist reconquest and reunification of America. Hoffman, the figurehead governor is the only stable figure, but how long will his strings prop up the state?"
 STX_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Texas was left devastated after the Union collapsed with the Great Depression hitting the state hard and it barely holding onto its revenue thanks to its oil production. Texas is strife with political chaos as upstarts try to make a name for themselves. The most pressing threat is not domestic however, it is external as the populists in Louisiana and Oklahoma seek to wage a war against the Texan behemoth to equalize the playing fields by kicking Texas while it is down. Will an independent Texas survive the 1930's?"
 SLA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Louisiana is a rapidly changing state, with parts of the state being a rural backwater and other parts showing shining examples of large urban cities. Populism is all the rage currently and with governor Oscar K. Allen's failing health the political jugernaut Huey Long is seeking to seize power and prepare for war with Texas to spread populism across the United States! Will Louisiana live up to its ambition?"
 MEX_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Mexico has been thrown into revolution ever sine the Mexican Revolution. Despite the government's attempts to stabilize the Country. The Cristeros had revolted with the help of the Europeans to establish a new country that cares little for human rights and only seeks to export oil for the ongoing war in Europe. What is left of the Mexican Government is now in Mexico City and the surrounding states. But now there is another Revolution brewing as the Hacendias and the Catholics seek to undermine the remaining Mexican Government and want to prevent any change that affects them. Lazaro Cardenas, a young soldier in the First Mexican Revolution has taken the presidency after Callas had lost most of his political power after the Rebellion. Cardenas now has to deal with the Catholics and the Hacendias while trying to create change in the country. Will Mexico survive the Revolution and take revenge on the rebels who caused the Second Revolution? Or will Mexico fall to the Catholics or the Hacendias?"
 SPA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Pennsylvania has been a unstable republic for as long as it’s independence. The current progressivist party has become severely unpopular as strikes have caused the 1934 election to be postponed to 1936. Polarization of politics has angered anarchists who have become more and more influential as the strikes have gone on. Democrats are infuriated at the current president for delaying a election despite the outcry for the election. So now the president will have to reassure the democrats and to end the strikes as soon as possible to prevent further anarchist influence in Pennsylvania. Many Pennsylvanians hope to see the late election be fulfilled yet there may be a chance that anarchists can take control if the strikes get worse. Only time will tell if Pennsylvania can remain democratic or else anarchists will take over."
 MDC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Second Mexican Revolution was a Victory for the Cristeros. Yet it had only became a stalemate for the Mexican Government and the Cristeros as a uneasy truce was signed. While the Mexican Government has lost most of it’s armed forces. The Cristeros army is only really a weak rebellion force instead of a professional army. It is inevitable that if the Mexican government goes to war with us, we would be in a hard position to win if our army remains weak. It doesn’t help that the Europeans will no longer trade our oil due to the stalemate in the ongoing war. Our Government has ambitions to reunite Mexico under the rule of Christ yet out government is weak at best. Will our rebellion remain alive to reunite Mexico or will we fall to the Mexican Government?"
 SCA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "California was the second state to break away from the Union back in 1930. As an independent republic, California sponsored the independence of its neighboring states under the guise of former governor Rolph. California's economic situation has still been hampered due to the Great Depression and any significant economic recovery has been impossible as the state has been plagued by internal violence and partisan politics aided by the mass media of Hollywood. The famous author turned politician; Upton Sinclair and his End Poverty In California movement have only contributed to the radicalization of Californian politics. This year's election has proven to be the most controversial in Californian history and will decide the future of this young restored Republic."
 SWA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Washington has been plagued by political extremism since the beginning of the century. Washington was the home of the most radicals per capita, on both left and right. The state's legacy of political extremism has come back with full force since the collapse of the Union, as democratic rule is becoming tenuous due to constant political violence and lack of economic relief due to a deadlocked state assembly. Outsiders expect Washington to fall to some form of radicalism during this extremely important election year."
 SRI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Rhode Island was the first state to secede from the Union. Our seccession triggered the domino effect of the Union's collapse. Our nation's industry relyed on Textiles, however currently textile workers are going on strike and leave a large portion of the state's industry gone. This isn't the only issue however as H.P Lovecraft has been stiring up popularity for his Socialist Party and many expect him to win the upcoming election. While on the other side William Stevens Lawton has been starting to sway the National Guard into attempting to cancel the election and putting him in power. While we plan to execute a 'Bloodless Revolution' to turn the state blue. Rhode Island has many things to conquer and it all depends on the upcoming election."
