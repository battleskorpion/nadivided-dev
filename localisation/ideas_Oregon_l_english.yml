  ORE_civlwar_econ_isshit_desc:0 "With the Oregon Civil War in full swing, the economies of the Oregon claimants have been geared for one thing-War. This has led to an increase in arms production at the cost of basic needs for civilians."
  ORE_KKK_Killed_Folk:0 "Legacy of the John Day Massacre"
  ORE_KKK_Killed_Folk_desc:0 "The John Day Massacre, a mass killing of 3000 people in the small town of John Day, was an action carried out by the KKK faction within the Oregon Democratic People’s Party. The massacre was the direct cause for the break up of the majority of the Unitary Republic’s held land. To the people of Eastern Oregon, the John Day Massacre is the sole reason they are killing each other as opposed to the Communists and Republicans in the West. "

  POO_Torch_Bearing:0 "Bearers of the Torch"
  POO_Torch_Bearing_desc:0 "The Portland Commune stands as the sole Anarchist society in North America, the sole bearer of the Torch of True Liberty, in perhaps the entire world. This is something we are willing to die for."
  POO_is_fucked:0 "Gridlocked Council"
  POO_is_fucked_desc:0 "The Portland Commune is ruled by the Portland Worker's Council, a body of elected representatives from every neighborhood, trade union, guild etc. These representatives all work tirelessly and selflessly for the betterment and glory of the entire Commune, and if they don't, the people who elected them can recall them in an instant, and it works flawlessly, at least on paper. In reality, the Council has been in gridlock since it's birth a short time ago.In fact, Portland's declaration of independence is so far the only act pushed through the Council. The Council itself has become the butt of a common joke for the people of Portland: 'You're working as almost as hard as the Council!'" 
  POO_isso_fucked:0 "Political Chaos"
  POO_isso_fucked_desc:0 "Despite the Council nominally being the sole legal political entity in the Commune, due to the constant gridlock, three distinct political systems have emerged in Portland. Namely, a Stalinist state, led by the Council of People's Commissars (a group who's funding from the Socialist Republic of Oregon is an open-secret), the old democratic mayoral system, led by newly elected mayor Oswald West (who is in fact a former governor of Oregon) and a true Anarcho-Syndicalist society, where every man works for the betterment of his fellow man. Due to how the Worker's Council is organized, these three governments exist in an almost constant state of small-scale warfare, fighting in hopes of gaining control of a neighborhood or trade union in order to gain full control of the Council, thus gaining full power over the entirety of Portland. However, whenever one neighborhood is taken by a faction, that same faction will no doubt lose a neighborhood of their own. The sole reason Portland has not collapsed entirely is due to the Socialist Republic of Oregon's promise to protect the independence of the Portland Commune"  
  POO_eco_fucked:0 "Economic Boom"
  POO_eco_fucked_desc:0 "A strange side effect of the anarchy that is the Portland Commune is that some neighborhoods have fallen under the control of certain corporations, be them local or multinational. This brings a boon to the economy due to the perfect libertarian political and economic conditions brought on by the anarchy, allowing these corporations to work without hindrances they would normally have in an established society. However the safety of workers is little more than a suggestion in these neighborhoods.."
  ORE_Civil_War:0 "The Oregon Civil War"
  ORE_Civil_War_desc:0 "Trench upon Trench. Charge upon useless charge. The stench of death everywhere. This is not describing anything from The Great War. This is in fact life for people in Oregon, a land gripped by an endless civil war. The Oregon Civil War may just be starting, but it is far from over."
  ORE_Cristero_Spirit:0 "Cristero Spirit"
  ORE_Cristero_Spirit_desc:0 "From 1926 to 1929, faithful Mexican Catholics fought tooth and nail to restore the Church of Christ to its rightful place in society, a concept alien to the atheistic government of Plutarco Calles who thought to snuff out the Church by force of arms. La Cristiada produced hundreds, if not thousands, of saints. We, the Catholic Faithful of Oregon, are the heirs of the Cristero Spirit! The Blood of the John Day Martyrs will be avenged! Viva Cristo Rey!"   
  ORE_Greater_Oregon:0 "Greater Oregon Dreams"
  ORE_Greater_Oregon_desc:0 "While the main reasoning behind Baker's revolt was to create an Oregon free of Communism and 'Jewish Influences' he has never been shy in stating that this dream will not be contained in the borders created in 1859. Baker's dream, he says, will be spread to Oregon's 'natural borders', the Oregon Country of old."
  ORE_Portland_Question:0 "The Portland Question"
  ORE_Portland_Question_desc:0 "When the IWW seized control of Portland  and proclaimed the Portland Commune, the Socialist Republic of Oregon was quick to recognize the new Worker's State. In private, Chairman Reed said that Portland could be a 'useful idiot' and would be a good ally. However, when Portland's Worker Council became gridlocked and Portland itself fell into anarchy, Reed started to choke on his words. The SRO was in a tough spot:They could either go back on their promise and easily annex the city, at the cost of legitimacy in the eyes of Oregonians, or they could keep their promise, and sink endless resources into the city, in the hopes that one day Portland would fix itself. Chairman Reed chose a middleground. The SRO would keep Portland as independent state, while 'covertly' funding allies in the city, in hopes they could take over the city and join the Socialist Republic as an Autonomous Socialist Republic. However, the people of Portland were quick to discover that the SRO was funding the infamous 'Council of People's Commissars' but due to the political chaos in Portland, no unified effort has been made to stop the shipments of arms, food and money. Chairman Reed's 'solution' to the Portland question is no solution at all. Reed will have to find a true solution to the Portland question soon, or he may not stay Chairman for long..."
  ORE_Powerless_Dudes:0 "Powerless Legislature"
  ORE_Powerless_Dudes_desc:0 "Due to either genuine democratic impulses, or because he hasn't gotten around to it, Governor Meier has allowed the democratic legislature to survive the declaration of martial law. Despite this, the legislature holds no power over the government. Although, there are whispers that senate majority leader William U'Ren will attempt to remove Meier from office(as he is rumored to see the declaration of martial law as an illegal takeover of the Republic), either legally or with the use of the National Guard. U'ren is a very progressive man, and if he were to come to power it is likely he would attempt to make peace with the Communists, but that is if he even wants to come to power, as he denies the rumors of planning a coup, at least for now..."
  ORE_beaver_state:0 "The Beaver State"
  ORE_beaver_state_desc:0 "Oregon, since its birth has been known as the Beaver State due to the many trappers who made their way into the State to hunt Beavers. We, the legitimate government of Oregon, are the only true claimants to this title. Long Live the Beaver State!"
  ORE_standing_firm:0 "Standing Firm"
  ORE_standing_firm_desc:0 "If the past 100 years have proved anything, it is that Oregon can endure. We endured the American Civil War. We endured the fall of the Union. The so-called Socialist 'Republic' would see everything the USA stood for banished! The Unitary 'Republic' would see Oregonians bled for land we haven't controlled for almost 100 years! The Catholics would have us become some sort of damn Papist Theocracy! The Klan would see democratic government's heart ripped out and stomped! The Cascadians would see Oregon lose its identity to a so-called 'Bioregion!' ENOUGH! We will end these upstarts and restore the true government of Oregon! We will once again fly with our own wings or die trying! WE SHALL STAND FIRM!"
  ORE_roaming_commies:0 "§RCommunist Insurgency§!"
  ORE_roaming_commies_desc:0 "When Oregon was freed from the dying hands of the old Union, a small army of Communists, aided by Soviet Advisors, began a guerilla war based out of the Cascades in hopes of toppling the newly proclaimed Republic of Oregon. All attempts to crush the Reds have ended in failure. We will have to deal with them soon or they may achieve their dream of a Red Oregon..."
  ORE_Baker_Dec:0 "The Baker Declaration"
  ORE_Baker_Dec_desc:0 "An Outline for the Reconstruction of Oregon, better known as The Baker Declaration, is both the fundlemental law and the guiding mainfesto for the Unitary Republic. In it, George Baker outlines his plans for Oregon:One free of outside infulences, free of secterian fighting and racial divide. On paper, this seems to be a wonderful dream, one of racial, social and poltical equility. In reailty, the Baker Declaration is a cover for a deeply authoritan system bend on removing from Oregon those who are deemed 'Unworthy' to live in this perfect society."
  ORE_Klams_Ofc:0 "Legacy of the Klamath Offensive"
  ORE_Klams_Ofc_desc:0 "The Klamath Offensive, as was clear to the both the URO and Jeffersonian high commands, was a total failure. Although the Offensive was able to complete it's objectives, it showed the complete lack of preperation and infecctivness of the URO's armed forces. On Jefferson's side of the coin, it should that, despite their knowlege of the local area, the Jeffersonian Republican Army is very much indeed of reform. Unless the mistakes from Klamath can be learned from, it is likely neither the URO or Jefferson will be able to hold their own in the coming wars"
