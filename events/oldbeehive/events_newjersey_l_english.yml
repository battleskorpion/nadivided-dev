    newjersey.1.t: "Hoffman Assassinated!" 
    newjersey.1.d: "Horror! As gunshots ring out during Hoffman’s Address! While reading out his pledge to guide New Jersey through these trying time,s he had announced the coming of a New Election, to reaffirm stability in the nation. However, during his speech he mentions that martial law is to remain in place until New Jersey is ‘Stabilized’, it was immediately after this that a black Ford V-8 rolled onto the scene and two armed thugs, reportedly assassinating Hoffman via a ‘driveby shooting’ the unorthodox and unprofessional nature leads many to believe it was an alleged ‘Mob Hit’ Hoffman and his Three guards were killed as the V-8 sped off. A Tank nearby, as part of the parade turned its turret to fire and blew the assassins to bits! The Military has once again taken control over New Jersey, and in a statement from the New Jersey State Guard has many fearing the end of democracy in the state. “By Collective decision, it is unfortunate, but New Jersey is not safe for democracy. Violence is rampant and our failure to keep the Governor alive is an example. It is a likely suspect that an Criminal Organization is behind this, and with several politicians side skirting issues for elections and bribes, it's time the Military clears the muck out of the state before reinstating elections.” The Nation has once again been brought into martial law. Alleged members of the ‘Mob’ have been rounded up, and have been publicly executed via Firing line. Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, the two famous Italian Anarchists who managed to escape their execution from 1927 have been located in New Jersey during the military’s search. The Men were shot and strung upside down from a nearby petrol station."

    newjersey.2.t: "State House in Flames!" 
    newjersey.2.d: "As ballots were opened poll papers turned to ash as riots broke out on the election day. The State House of New Jersey was set aflame today in an attack against the government which many sources are claiming to come from the members of the Red Ticket party. Thankfully Harold G. Hoffman, the Governor of New Jersey successfully made it out of the building in time with his life. Unfortunately as the day went on, the military has lost control over several portions of the state, devolving into anarchy and looting.  Ultranationalists paramilitary forces have since defected to their own holdouts and demanding the persecution of those who have set the blaze. Frank T. Johns, leader of the Red Ticket party of New Jersey has made a statement regarding the burning, claiming it was sabotage and a setup by the nationalist elements of the nation. “The fumbling of the military’s election handling may give rise to violence understandable, though if there is any blame it lies on the military’s handling of the affair.” Many in New Jersey fear a civil war is brewing and the American dream, for those who believe New Jersey the proper successor had ‘Died where it was once saved’. Herbert Hoover, the former American President has spoken on the matter stating “New Jersey was the final state, the final straw. America as we knew it, is a dead nation. However, I warn you all that New Jersey’s hubris of ‘Saving’ the revolution, will fan the flames of strife should the nationalists take power”.  It is worth noting that Adolf Hitler, the führer of the German Reich has expressed sympathies to the State, granting the Reichstag fire not too long ago."

    newjersey.3.t: "The Red Ticket, Legal!" 
    newjersey.3.d: "As the military continues to lose its dictatorial grip on New Jersey, a consensus backed both by the Popular front, a union of socialist groups in New Jersey, and several Communist Paramilitaries have led to the legal voting of Socialist parties for New Jersey. A Stipulation was added however, to divide the parties into three separate entries on the ballots, in conservative hopes of destroying left unity. Frank T. Johns, the Chairman of the Red Ticket, formerly Popular Front, has gone onto denounce the arrangement, accusing the Paramilitaries of promoting Radicalization. The Anarcho-Syndicalist fringe party known as, “Black Jersey”’s leader, ‘André Travelliour’ has stated that the election shall remain peaceful, and so will the aftermath if they win. The Former Desegregation party, turned Revolutionary Socialist movement has invited a leftist Kuomintang member from the Guangxi clique, Soong Mei-Ling to New Jersey, in hopes of boosting popularity with Asian Americans."
